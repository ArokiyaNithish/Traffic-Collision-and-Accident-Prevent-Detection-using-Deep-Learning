## 📌 Abstract

This project is titled **"Traffic Collision and Accident Prevention Detection Using Deep Learning for Community Services"** and focuses on addressing the critical issue of road accidents, particularly on highways, using a deep learning-based system.

A custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / YOLOv8** model processes video streams in real time, achieving high accuracy in object detection through feature extraction and classification. The system detects vehicles and pedestrians using bounding boxes, calculates vehicle speed, and estimates the distance between objects using the **Euclidean distance formula**. If a high-speed vehicle approaches a potential collision, the system triggers an alert for timely intervention.

Visual feedback including bounding boxes and speed indicators enhances the system's effectiveness. The project ensures **real-time processing, high accuracy, and scalability** — providing an innovative and efficient method for improving road safety and community welfare.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ **Detect vehicles and pedestrians in real-time** using YOLOv8 deep learning model
- ✅ **Calculate proximity** between detected objects using the Euclidean distance formula
- ✅ **Trigger collision warnings** automatically when threshold distance is breached
- ✅ **Deploy IoT hardware** (ESP32-CAM + GPS + Wi-Fi) for real-world highway deployment
- ✅ **Alert emergency services** with GPS-tagged location when collision risk is detected
- ✅ **Conduct community survey** at Redhills, Chennai to validate real-world impact
- ✅ **Scale to smart city** traffic management infrastructure in future phases

## 🔴 Problem Statement

Road traffic accidents are one of the most pressing and persistent social challenges faced globally and particularly in developing countries like **India**.

- 🇮🇳 India alone witnesses more than **400 deaths per day** due to road crashes, according to national reports.
- According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among individuals aged **5–29 years**, with over **1.3 million fatalities annually**.
- Areas like **Redhills**, a critical junction connecting Chennai with northern districts of Tamil Nadu, face unique challenges due to:
  - Heavy traffic congestion on NH-16, NH-716, and the Outer Ring Road (ORR)
  - Poorly monitored intersections
  - Insufficient traffic management systems
  - Lack of real-time hazard alerts
  - Delayed emergency response times
  - Reliance solely on manual physical patrolling & CCTV without AI integration

> **"Traditional accident detection systems in Redhills are limited to physical patrolling, CCTV surveillance with no AI integration, and public reporting — resulting in delayed awareness, prolonged emergency response times, and a lack of real-time data collection."**

This initiative also aligns with **United Nations SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**, emphasizing the role of smart technologies in urban safety and resilience.

## ✅ Solution & Approach

The proposed solution is a **real-time AI-based Traffic Collision and Accident Prevention Alert System** that uses:

1. **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) Deep Learning Model** — detects vehicles and pedestrians in video frames with high accuracy.
2. **Euclidean Distance Calculation** — estimates proximity between detected objects to predict potential collisions.
3. **Real-Time Alert System** — triggers visual alerts (bounding boxes + warning text on screen) when a collision risk is detected.
4. **ESP32-CAM Microcontroller** — enables edge processing for embedded deployment on highways.
5. **GPS Module** — provides precise location tracking of accident zones.
6. **Wi-Fi Communication** — enables instant alert transmission to traffic police and emergency responders.

### How It Works

```
Video Input (Camera/Video File)
        ↓
YOLOv8 Object Detection
        ↓
Identify Vehicles & Pedestrians
        ↓
Calculate Euclidean Distance Between Objects
        ↓
Distance < Threshold? → ⚠️ Collision Warning Triggered
        ↓
Alert Emergency Services / Traffic Police
```

---

## 🔧 How the Project Works

The system works by continuously processing a live video stream to detect vehicles and pedestrians, calculating the risk of collision in real time, and triggering alerts when danger is imminent.

### Step-by-Step Working

#### Step 1 — Video Input Capture
The system captures a **live video stream** from:
- A connected **webcam** or **IP camera** mounted at a traffic location
- A **pre-recorded traffic video file** for testing
- An **ESP32-CAM module** for embedded edge deployment on highways

Each frame is processed sequentially in real time using **OpenCV**.

📺 *Resource:* [OpenCV Video Capture Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWP6UjDeZvY&t=39)

#### Step 2 — Detect Vehicles with YOLOv8
Each video frame is passed through the **YOLOv8** model:
- Performs **object classification and localization** in a single forward pass
- Produces **bounding boxes** `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` around each detected vehicle
- Only keeps detections with confidence ≥ **0.4 (40%)**
- Vehicle classes detected: `Car (2)`, `Motorcycle (3)`, `Bus (5)`, `Truck (7)`

📺 *Resource:* [Vehicle Detection with YOLOv8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWP6UjDeZvY&t=39)

#### Step 3 — Detect Pedestrians with YOLOv8
Using the same YOLOv8 model, pedestrians (`class 0 = person`) are identified in the frame with their bounding boxes.

📺 *Resource:* [Pedestrian Detection with YOLOv8 + DeepSORT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIRRuGN0j5E)

#### Step 4 — Filter Detections by ROI (Region of Interest)
Detections are filtered to only those **within the defined ROI** — the specific zone of the road where collision detection is relevant (e.g., a pedestrian crossing or highway merge point).

📺 *Resource:* [People Counting in ROI with OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t61EqN8ZwDQ)
📺 *Resource:* [Retail Counter / ROI Zone Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAWpsIuem10&t=1519s)

#### Step 5 — Calculate Distance Between Bounding Boxes
For every vehicle–pedestrian pair detected in the ROI, the **Euclidean distance** between their bounding box centers is calculated:

```
distance = √((cx₂ - cx₁)² + (cy₂ - cy₁)²)
```

where `(cx, cy)` is the center point of each bounding box.

📺 *Resource:* [Distance Calculation with Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE8am1QoVn4)

#### Step 6 — Collision Warning Triggered
If `distance < THRESHOLD (100 pixels)`, a collision risk is flagged:
- ⚠️ **Warning text** is overlaid on the video frame
- Both at-risk objects are highlighted with **red bounding boxes**
- *(IoT upgrade)* **Buzzer** sounds at the roadside unit
- *(IoT upgrade)* **Wi-Fi alert** is transmitted via ESP32 to the police portal
- *(IoT upgrade)* **GPS coordinates** of the incident are included in the alert

#### Step 7 — Draw Bounding Boxes & Display
- **Blue boxes** — Safe vehicles
- **Green boxes** — Pedestrians (safe)
- **Red boxes + ⚠️ text** — Collision risk pair
- The annotated frame is displayed in real time via OpenCV window

#### Step 8 — Exit & Resource Release
The loop continues until the video ends or the user presses `Q`. Resources are then released:
```python
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## 💻 Main Program

**File:** [`Traffic Collision Alert System using Deep learning.py`](./Traffic%20Collision%20Alert%20System%20using%20Deep%20learning.py)

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from ultralytics import YOLO
import math

# Load YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Use yolov8n.pt or yolov8s.pt

# Classes: 0 = person, 2-7 = vehicles (car, motorcycle, bus, truck)
VEHICLE_CLASSES = [2, 3, 5, 7]
PERSON_CLASS = 0
DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 100  # Pixel distance for collision warning

# Video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("input_video.mp4")  # Replace with 0 for webcam

def calculate_distance(box1, box2):
    x1, y1 = int((box1[0] + box1[2]) / 2), int((box1[1] + box1[3]) / 2)
    x2, y2 = int((box2[0] + box2[2]) / 2), int((box2[1] + box2[3]) / 2)
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
```

**Key Features of the Program:**
- Loads pretrained **YOLOv8** model for object detection
- Detects vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles) and pedestrians from video
- Calculates **Euclidean distance** between each vehicle–pedestrian pair
- Triggers **⚠️ Collision Warning** on screen when distance < threshold (100 pixels)
- Highlights objects with **color-coded bounding boxes** (Red = collision risk, Blue = vehicle, Green = person)
- Supports both **video file input** and **live webcam feed**

## 🔍 Code Analysis

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **YOLOv8 over older YOLO versions** | YOLOv8 provides significantly better mAP and speed for real-time detection |
| **Euclidean Distance over IoU** | Simpler to compute per-frame; sufficient for proximity-based collision risk in this use case |
| **ROI Filtering** | Limits detection to the accident-prone zone, reducing false positives from irrelevant objects |
| **100-pixel threshold** | Calibrated for typical camera distances at intersections; adjustable per deployment |
| **ESP32-CAM for edge deployment** | Low-cost (<$10), built-in camera + Wi-Fi, battery operable — ideal for highway installations |
| **GPS Neo-6M module** | Wide availability, low cost, and compatible UART interface with ESP32 |
| **Confidence ≥ 0.4** | Balances detection recall vs. false positives — reduces noise without missing real hazards |
| **Color-coded bounding boxes** | Instant visual feedback for human operators monitoring video feeds |

### Algorithm Complexity

| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| YOLOv8 Inference | O(1) per frame | Fixed model size; GPU-accelerated |
| Euclidean Distance | O(V × P) | V = vehicles, P = pedestrians per frame |
| ROI Filtering | O(N) | N = total detections per frame |
| Total per frame | ~O(V × P) | Typically very small N, negligible overhead |

### Script Dependency Map

```
Video Input (Camera / File / ESP32-CAM)
         ↓
OpenCV VideoCapture → Frame extraction
         ↓
YOLOv8 Model → Vehicle + Pedestrian detection
         ↓
ROI Filter → Remove out-of-zone detections
         ↓
Euclidean Distance → Per pair calculation
         ↓
Threshold Check → Collision warning trigger
         ↓
[IoT] ESP32 Wi-Fi → GPS Alert to Police Portal
```
